# Welcome MemoryLane üëã

Memory Lane is an app asks lovers questions based on their shared experiences. Example questions include: 1. Where did we go to on our first date 2. When did we have our first date (e.g Dec 01,2025) 3. What did I have on our first Date (e.g Chapman and pepper soup, Rice and Chicken, Coffee, etc) 4. Where did we meet? 5. What did I say the first time met? 6. I said the word ‚Äústomach‚Äù on our first date,
true/false? 7. Etc

- Lovers can create questions for each other. Questions can be anything ranging from their first date, to a fun outing they had yesterday, or a conversation they had in the morning. If I post a question, my partner will get a pop-up notification to answer. As they answer, the points accumulate based on number of % of questions answered correctly.Think. How can AI be integrated: Maybe analysing the quality of the questions to determine the strength of the relationship? Maybe build a memory map based on the questions which could be about where they went, what they did, etc.
- Maybe scores can be a percentage of how many questions answered. Or make the game turn by turn. I ask you, then you ask me. But if one partner is more likely to engage in the game, they should get to post as many questions they want without waiting on the other person to post a question. On the other hand, ‚Äòturn by turn‚Äô can make it more engaging. If pat. A asks what did I order on our first date. Pat. B before/after answering should have the option to repeat the same question to pat. A or ask a different question.
- When posting a question, user should be able to ask either a text-based, multiple choice (with 4 options) or true/false questions.
- Should I call the app MemoryLane so that friends (not in romantic relationships) can also play or LoveMemory to make it enticing to people in romantic relationships. What other names can make it enticing to both groups (romantic and platonic friendships). For future update, I may consider expanding it to include more than two players, so that family‚Äôs can also play memory lane based on shared experiences.
- How can I motivate users to post questions to create engagements, instead of just answering to gain points. Maybe user should earn a point when they post a question. Maybe same or different point from the answerer. (Checkout how skribble.io does it)
- Some users may struggle with coming up with the question to ask. There should be suggested questions to the user, based on the type of relationship (romantic/platonic/family/etc). The suggested questions should exclude user‚Äôs question history, because I don‚Äôt want them repeating the same question.
- What will be a very good home page for this app. A home page that is both enticing and containing features to will encourage engagement, at the same time simple, beautiful design, with only the necessary features that encourages engaement.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
